Install instructions
====================

*) Install a simple web server (nginx):
        sudo apt-get install nginx-common nginx-light

*) Build and install the arxiv-transform tools. From the source directory:
        mkdir build && cd build
        cmake ../
        make
        make install

*) Run the web server: (note: the path has to be absolute here)
        nginx -c /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform/nginx.conf

   This command should be added to your list of commands to run at startup as well.

*) Setup a cron job to poll the arXiv daily. For example, open your cron table with:
        crontab -e

   Then add this line to the file to poll the arXiv every day at 7am:
        00 07 * * * /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform/poll_arxiv_oai.sh /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform

   The command should also be ran at startup, since you may only start your computer after 7am...
        /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform/poll_arxiv_oai.sh /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform

*) To continue we need a first poll of the arXiv. We do not want to wait until 7am the next day,
   or to restart the computer, so we can run the script manually (just this one time):
        /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform/poll_arxiv_oai.sh /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform

*) Then open your favorite RSS reader and use the following RSS feed:
        http://localhost:8080/arxiv/rss/feed.rss

   If you are using Thunderbird, you need a "Blog and news" account. If you don't have one already,
   go to "Edit > Account Settings > Account Actions > Add Feed account...". This will add a new
   entry alongside your inbox.

   Right click on that entry and choose "Subscribe...", then write the above URL in the "Feed URL"
   edit box. Then press "Add".

*) And that's it! Now you will get an RSS feed from the arXiv without missing any article if you go
   traveling without internet connection for a week. You can also edit the preferences.xml file to
   setup some filtering to reduce the amount of papers that appear in the RSS feed. See next
   section.


Customizing RSS feed
====================

Open the file:
    /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform/preferences.xml

This file controls, among other things, the various filters that can be applied to the arXiv
entries before they are sent to the RSS feed. Below is a description of all these options.

*) keep_history
This defines the amount of time a paper will remain in the RSS feed. Papers older than this will
be removed. You should set this amount of time to the longest time you may expect your computer to
be turned off (or without internet access). The syntax is that of the "date" command line tool, so
you can have "3 days ago" or "1 month ago". For example:
    <pref name="keep_history">2 weeks ago</pref>

*) star_include
This is a list of comma-separated words or expressions that will be searched for in each paper's
title and abstract. If at least one of these is found, the paper will appear with a little star in
its title in your RSS feed. These are case-insensitive. For example:
    <pref name="content_must_include">galaxy, main sequence, main-sequence, bulges</pref>

*) content_exclude
Same as above, except that a paper is deleted if any of these words or expressions is found in the
title or abstract.
    <pref name="content_must_include">chemistry, neutralino, reionization</pref>

*) categories_must_include/categories_exclude
These two options function exactly the same as star_include and content_exclude, but will
be applied to the arXiv category string instead. The category string contains all the categories
the paper has been attributed to. There can be only one category (usually), or several is the
paper has been crossposted. For example:
    <pref name="categories_must_include">astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</pref>
    <pref name="categories_exclude">gr-qc, astro-ph.SR</pref>
... will only display articles listed in astro-ph.GA or astro-ph.CO, and will exclude those that
are also listed in gr-qc and astro-ph.SR.

*) allow_crosspost
Set this to "0" to hide all entries that are listed in more than one arXiv category.

*) allow_replacements
Set this to "0" to only show papers when they appear on arXiv for the first time, and hide
announcements for updates and revisions.

*) only_accepted
Set this to "1" to only display the papers that contain the word "accepted" in their comment
field. The goal is to only list papers that are accepted for publication, rather than just
submitted. This option will take precedence over "allow_replacement", so you may see the same
paper appearing twice if the authors update the arXiv version multiple times after the paper
has been accepted.
